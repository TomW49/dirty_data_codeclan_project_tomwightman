# dirty_data_codeclan_project_tomwightman

This project is for the purpose of my first dirty data project with CodeClan. 

## Background

I have chosen to complete "Task 1" on decathlon results, a small data set with minimal cleaning. This data comprised of data from two decathlon competitions.

I have also completed "Task 4" , combining 3 data sets on halloween candy from 2015-2017. They are results from polls sent to people globally on what candy they like, and to rate it either "JOY", "MEH' or "DESPAIR". This data was fairly dirty and required a lot of cleaning. 

This project folder also contains an extra_dplyr_practice folder, which houses small tasks completed in order to begin Task 1 and Task 4.

## Languages/Technology 

This project will use R with R Studios.

## How to run the project

Read in "clean_decathlon.rds into .Rmd file for cleaned data to analyse in Task 1 folder.

Read in "clean_halloween_candy_2015_to_2017.csv" into .Rmd file for cleaned data to analyse in Task 4 folder.

For analysis and docs, got to documentation_and_analysis filen in both task folders.
